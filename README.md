# Task-Specific  Design  Optimization  and  Fabrication  for Inflated-Beam  Soft  Robots  with  Growable  Discrete  Joints

Code accompanying the above paper submission. Algorithm performing design and configuration optimization for a soft robot to reach several targets with prescribed end-effector orientations. Optimization is done using a sampling-based method, namely Adaptive Stochastic Search.
